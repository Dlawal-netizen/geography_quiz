    <h2>Types of Volcanoes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strato-volcanoes (Composite Cone Volcanoes):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Tall, steep-sided, and conical, formed by alternating layers of lava, ash, and volcanic debris.</li>
          <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Explosive eruptions due to viscous magma with high silica content, commonly found near subduction zones.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Mount Fuji (Japan), Mount St. Helens (USA).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Shield Volcanoes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Broad and gently sloping, formed by the accumulation of low-viscosity basaltic lava.</li>
          <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Non-explosive eruptions with lava flowing over long distances, common at divergent plate boundaries and hotspots.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Mauna Loa and Kilauea (Hawaii).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Features of Volcanoes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Crater:</strong> A bowl-shaped depression at the top of a volcano, formed by explosive activity or collapse.</li>
      <li><strong>Vent:</strong> The opening through which magma, gases, and volcanic material are ejected.</li>
      <li><strong>Magma Chamber:</strong> A reservoir of molten rock beneath the Earth's surface that feeds eruptions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Features of Earthquakes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Epicentre:</strong> The point on the Earth's surface directly above the earthquake's origin.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus (Hypocentre):</strong> The location beneath the Earth's surface where the earthquake begins.</li>
      <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> A measure of the energy released during an earthquake, often measured on the Richter scale.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Global Pattern of Plates and Their Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Earth's lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere.</li>
      <li><strong>Plate Movements:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Constructive/Divergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move apart, forming new crust and mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge).</li>
          <li><strong>Destructive/Convergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move toward each other, leading to subduction, volcanic activity, and mountain formation (e.g., Andes Mountains).</li>
          <li><strong>Conservative/Transform Boundaries:</strong> Plates slide past one another, causing earthquakes (e.g., San Andreas Fault).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Subduction Zones:</strong> Areas where one plate is forced beneath another, creating trenches, volcanic arcs, and seismic activity.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Effects of Plate Movements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Constructive Boundaries:</strong> Formation of new crust, mid-ocean ridges, and shield volcanoes.</li>
      <li><strong>Destructive Boundaries:</strong> Formation of trenches, composite volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain ranges.</li>
      <li><strong>Conservative Boundaries:</strong> Frequent earthquakes due to the friction of sliding plates.</li>

  <h1>Benefits of Living Near Volcanoes and Hazardous Areas</h1>

  <h2>Some Benefits of Living Near Volcanoes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fertile Soil:</strong> Volcanic ash enriches soil with nutrients, making it ideal for agriculture.</li>
    <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Volcanic areas often provide a sustainable source of geothermal energy.</li>
    <li><strong>Tourism Opportunities:</strong> Volcanoes attract tourists, boosting the local economy.</li>
    <li><strong>Mineral Resources:</strong> Volcanoes can produce valuable minerals like sulfur, gold, and diamonds.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural and Historical Significance:</strong> Many volcanic regions hold cultural and religious importance for local communities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Some Other Reasons People Live in Hazardous Areas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Economic Opportunities:</strong> Fertile land, mining, or tourism can make hazardous areas attractive.</li>
    <li><strong>Family and Tradition:</strong> People may have deep cultural or ancestral ties to the area.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Alternatives:</strong> Limited resources may prevent relocation to safer areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignorance of Risks:</strong> People may underestimate the risks or believe they won't be affected.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Developed infrastructure in hazardous areas often outweighs the risk for many.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Case Studies</h2>

  <div class="case-study">
    <h3>Case Study 1: MEDC - Mount St. Helens, USA (1980 Eruption)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The eruption destroyed 250 homes, 47 bridges, and caused massive damage to forestry and infrastructure. 57 people died.</li>
      <li><strong>Response:</strong> The USA's advanced emergency response systems evacuated many people before the eruption, limiting the death toll.</li>
      <li><strong>Rebuilding:</strong> The government invested heavily in rebuilding infrastructure, restoring the affected areas, and studying volcanic behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Preparedness:</strong> Long-term monitoring systems were established to provide better warnings of future eruptions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="case-study">
    <h3>Case Study 2: LEDC - Mount Nyiragongo, Democratic Republic of Congo (2002 Eruption)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Impact:</strong> The eruption killed 245 people, left 120,000 homeless, and caused extensive damage to the city of Goma.</li>
      <li><strong>Response:</strong> Limited emergency services struggled to respond effectively. International aid provided food, shelter, and medical support.</li>
      <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Poor infrastructure and lack of resources slowed recovery efforts. Many people were forced to return to dangerous areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Highlighted the need for better disaster management and international support in LEDCs.</li>
