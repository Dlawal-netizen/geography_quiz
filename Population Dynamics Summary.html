            <h2>1. Key Population Concepts</h2>
            <p><strong>Population</strong>: The total number of people living in a given area.</p>
            <p><strong>Population Density</strong>: The number of people per unit area, usually measured in people per square kilometer.</p>
            <p><strong>Population Distribution</strong>: The pattern of where people live. It can be uneven, with some areas densely populated (e.g., cities) and others sparsely populated (e.g., deserts).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Population Change</h2>
            <p>Population change is influenced by three main factors: <strong>birth rate</strong>, <strong>death rate</strong>, and <strong>migration</strong>.</p>
            <h3>a. Birth Rate</h3>
            <p>The number of live births per 1,000 people per year. High birth rates are often associated with lack of access to contraception and high infant mortality rates.</p>

            <h3>b. Death Rate</h3>
            <p>The number of deaths per 1,000 people per year. Low death rates are attributed to improved healthcare and sanitation.</p>

            <h3>c. Natural Increase</h3>
            <p>The difference between birth rate and death rate.</p>

            <h3>d. Migration</h3>
            <p>The movement of people from one place to another, either within a country (internal migration) or between countries (international migration).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Causes of High and Low Birth and Death Rates</h1>
    
    <h2>Causes of High Birth Rate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Family Planning:</strong> Limited access to contraception and education.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Norms:</strong> Preference for large families in some societies.</li>
        <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> Larger families seen as economic support in rural or poor areas.</li>
        <li><strong>High Infant Mortality:</strong> Families have more children as insurance against child mortality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of High Death Rate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Poor Healthcare:</strong> Limited access to medical services and medicines.</li>
        <li><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> Insufficient food availability leads to weakened immunity.</li>
        <li><strong>Disease Outbreaks:</strong> Lack of sanitation and vaccination contributes to epidemics.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict and Natural Disasters:</strong> Wars and environmental crises increase mortality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of Low Birth Rate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Higher education levels, especially for women, delay childbearing.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Stability:</strong> Career priorities and urbanization lead to fewer children.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Contraception:</strong> Widespread family planning services reduce unplanned pregnancies.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural Shifts:</strong> Changing attitudes towards smaller families and delayed marriages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of Low Death Rate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advanced Healthcare:</strong> Access to modern medical care and vaccinations.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Nutrition:</strong> Better food supply and reduced hunger.</li>
        <li><strong>Sanitation and Hygiene:</strong> Clean water and waste management prevent diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Peaceful Societies:</strong> Lower conflict levels and disaster preparedness reduce fatalities.</li>
    </ul>

            <h2>3. Factors Influencing Population Distribution/Density</h2>
            <h3>Physical Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Climate: Harsh climates have lower populations.</li>
                <li>Relief: Flat, fertile plains attract more people.</li>
                <li>Natural Resources: Areas rich in resources attract settlements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Human Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Economic Opportunities: Jobs encourage population growth in urban areas.</li>
                <li>Political Stability: Stable governments attract people.</li>
                <li>Healthcare and Education: Access to these services lowers death rates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Population Structures</h2>
            <p>The <strong>age-sex structure</strong> of a population is represented using a <strong>population pyramid</strong>.</p>
            <h3>LEDC Population Pyramids</h3>
            <p>Wide base, narrow apex, high birth rates, high death rates, and short life expectancy.</p>

            <h2>5. Population Policies</h2>
            <h3>Pro-natalist Policies</h3>
            <p>Encourage higher birth rates to counteract aging populations. Examples include financial incentives and extended parental leave.</p>

            <h3>Anti-natalist Policies</h3>
            <p>Aim to reduce birth rates to manage overpopulation. Examples include family planning education and access to contraception.</p>

    <h1>Effects of Aging and Youthful Populations</h1>
    
    <h2>Effects of an Aging Population</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Strain:</strong> Increased government spending on pensions and healthcare.</li>
        <li><strong>Labor Shortages:</strong> Smaller working-age population reduces economic productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency Ratio:</strong> Higher dependency on the working population to support retirees.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Pressure:</strong> Greater demand for medical and elderly care services.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Changes:</strong> Shift in societal focus toward policies for the elderly, such as retirement benefits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Effects of a Youthful Population</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Education Demand:</strong> Pressure on resources to provide education and training.</li>
        <li><strong>High Dependency Ratio:</strong> Fewer working-age individuals to support dependents.</li>
        <li><strong>Job Market Strain:</strong> Insufficient employment opportunities lead to unemployment or underemployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Potential Economic Growth:</strong> Opportunity for a demographic dividend if properly educated and employed.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Challenges:</strong> Increased demand for housing, healthcare, and infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
