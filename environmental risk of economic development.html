       <header> <h1>Environmental Risks of Economic Development</h1></header>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Economic development is essential for improving living standards and boosting national income, but it often comes at a cost to the environment and people. Rapid industrialization, urban expansion, deforestation, and resource exploitation have led to serious environmental risks, both locally and globally.</p>

        <h2>2. How Economic Activities Pose Threats to the Environment and People</h2>
        <p>Several economic activities contribute to environmental degradation:</p>

        <h3>A. Soil Erosion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Caused by deforestation, overgrazing, intensive farming, and construction.</li>
            <li>Leads to loss of fertile land, lower agricultural yields, and increased desertification.</li>
            <li>Affects water quality as eroded soil ends up in rivers and lakes, leading to siltation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Desertification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Expansion of deserts due to overgrazing, deforestation, and poor land management.</li>
            <li>Causes reduced agricultural productivity, water shortages, and displacement of communities.</li>
            <li>Examples: The Sahel region in Africa, parts of China, and Australia.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Enhanced Global Warming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Result of increased greenhouse gas emissions from industries, transportation, and deforestation.</li>
            <li>Leads to rising temperatures, ice cap melting, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.</li>
            <li>Affects biodiversity and increases the frequency of natural disasters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>D. Pollution</h3>
        <p>Pollution is one of the biggest threats to the environment and human health. It can be categorized into:</p>

        <h4>1. Water Pollution</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Caused by industrial waste, oil spills, sewage discharge, and agricultural chemicals.</li>
            <li>Harms aquatic life, contaminates drinking water, and spreads diseases.</li>
            <li>Examples: Oil spills in the Niger Delta, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Air Pollution</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Caused by vehicle emissions, industrial fumes, and burning of fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Leads to respiratory diseases, acid rain, and global warming.</li>
            <li>Examples: Smog in Beijing, air pollution in Delhi.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Noise Pollution</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Comes from industries, traffic, and urbanization.</li>
            <li>Leads to stress, hearing problems, and wildlife disturbances.</li>
            <li>Examples: Airports, industrial zones, and highways in densely populated cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Visual Pollution</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Caused by billboards, power lines, construction sites, and waste dumps.</li>
            <li>Reduces aesthetic value of landscapes and affects mental well-being.</li>
            <li>Examples: Overcrowded cities, unmanaged landfills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The Need for Sustainable Development and Management</h2>
        <p>Sustainable development ensures that economic growth does not destroy natural resources for future generations. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing pollution and waste through better industrial practices.</li>
            <li>Using renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>Implementing reforestation programs and sustainable agriculture.</li>
            <li>Encouraging eco-friendly transportation and urban planning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Importance of Resource Conservation</h2>
        <p>Resource conservation helps ensure the availability of natural resources for future generations. Key methods include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recycling and reusing materials to reduce waste.</li>
            <li>Promoting efficient use of water, energy, and raw materials.</li>
            <li>Enforcing laws to prevent over-extraction and habitat destruction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Case Study: Environmental Risk from Economic Development</h2>
        <div class="case-study">
            <h3>Case Study: Amazon Rainforest - Deforestation Due to Economic Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Brazil and surrounding countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Main Economic Activities:</strong> Logging, cattle ranching, soybean farming, mining.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Risks:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deforestation leading to loss of biodiversity.</li>
                        <li>Disruption of the water cycle, causing regional droughts.</li>
                        <li>Increase in carbon dioxide levels due to deforestation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Indigenous tribes losing land and resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Response:</strong> Conservation programs and protected areas.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Economic development is crucial for improving living conditions, but it must be balanced with environmental protection. Sustainable management practices are necessary to minimize risks and conserve natural resources for future generations.</p>
