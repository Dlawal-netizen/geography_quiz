        <h1>River Processes</h1>
    </header>

    <div>
        <p>Rivers are dynamic systems that shape the landscape through a variety of physical processes. These processes are categorized into <strong>erosion</strong>, <strong>transportation</strong>, and <strong>deposition</strong>, which influence the river's course and surrounding environment.</p>

        <h2>1. Erosion</h2>
        <p>Erosion involves the wearing away of the river's bed, banks, and the materials it carries. There are four main types of erosion:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydraulic Action</strong>: The force of moving water dislodges particles from the riverbed and banks. This process is most effective in fast-flowing rivers with high energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Abrasion (Corrasion)</strong>: Sediments carried by the river grind against the bed and banks, acting like sandpaper. This process deepens and widens the river channel.</li>
            <li><strong>Attrition</strong>: Rocks and pebbles carried by the river collide with each other, breaking into smaller, rounder pieces over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution (Corrosion)</strong>: River water dissolves soluble minerals from the rocks and sediments, such as calcium carbonate from limestone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Transportation</h2>
        <p>Transportation is the movement of eroded material downstream. Rivers transport material through four main processes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traction</strong>: Large boulders and rocks roll along the riverbed, typically during periods of high discharge.</li>
            <li><strong>Saltation</strong>: Smaller pebbles and stones are bounced along the riverbed in a leapfrog motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Suspension</strong>: Fine particles, such as silt and clay, are carried within the water column, giving the river a muddy appearance.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Dissolved minerals are transported invisibly in the water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The capacity and competence of a river (the total amount and size of material it can transport) depend on its velocity and discharge.</p>

        <h2>3. Deposition</h2>
        <p>Deposition occurs when the river loses energy and can no longer carry its load. Factors influencing deposition include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A decrease in river velocity, often due to a reduction in gradient or discharge.</li>
            <li>The presence of obstacles, such as vegetation or rocks.</li>
            <li>A widening of the river channel or when the river enters a lake or sea.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Deposition leads to the formation of various landforms, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Floodplains</strong>: Flat areas adjacent to the river, formed by layers of silt and sediment deposited during floods.</li>
            <li><strong>Levees</strong>: Raised embankments along the riverbanks created by repeated deposition during flooding.</li>
            <li><strong>Deltas</strong>: Deposits of sediment at the river's mouth, where it meets a body of still water like a lake or sea.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. River Landforms</h2>
        <p>River processes create distinct landforms in the upper, middle, and lower courses of the river:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upper Course</strong>: V-shaped valleys, waterfalls, and interlocking spurs.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Course</strong>: Meanders and oxbow lakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Course</strong>: Floodplains, levees, and deltas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. River Profiles</h2>
        <p>Rivers typically follow a long profile with three main sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upper Course</strong>: Characterized by steep gradients, high energy, and vertical erosion.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle Course</strong>: Marked by gentler slopes, lateral erosion, and increased transportation.</li>
            <li><strong>Lower Course</strong>: Features very gentle gradients, deposition, and large landforms like deltas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Flooding</h2>
        <p>Flooding is a natural process that occurs when a river exceeds its capacity. Factors influencing flooding include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical Factors</strong>: Intense rainfall, impermeable geology, and steep slopes.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Factors</strong>: Urbanization, deforestation, and poorly managed river engineering.</li>
        </ul>
