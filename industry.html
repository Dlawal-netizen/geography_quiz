    <h1>3. Factors Influencing the Distribution and Location of Industry</h1>
    <h2>A. Land</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Availability and Cost:</strong> Industrial operations often require large tracts of land; low-cost land may be preferable.</li>
      <li><strong>Suitability:</strong> Land should be appropriate for heavy construction, infrastructure, and sometimes for environmental safety zones.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>B. Labour</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Availability:</strong> A skilled and accessible workforce is crucial.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost and Demographics:</strong> Wages, local employment laws, and population demographics influence location.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>C. Raw Materials</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proximity to Sources:</strong> Being near raw material sources minimizes transportation costs and supply chain risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality and Reliability:</strong> Consistent supply of high-quality raw materials supports efficient production.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>D. Fuel and Power</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energy Supply:</strong> Reliable and cost-effective energy is necessary, whether from fossil fuels, electricity grids, or renewable sources.</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Proximity to power plants or energy hubs can reduce operational costs.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>E. Transport</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Well-connected by road, rail, sea, or air to facilitate distribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Lower transportation costs can make a location more attractive.</li>
      <li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Proximity to ports, highways, and rail networks is critical for exporting/importing goods.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>F. Markets</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consumer Proximity:</strong> Factories often locate near large consumer markets to reduce distribution costs.</li>
      <li><strong>Demand Factors:</strong> Local, regional, or global market demands can influence the scale and type of production.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>G. Political Factors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Government Policies:</strong> Incentives like tax breaks, subsidies, or relaxed regulations can attract industries.</li>
      <li><strong>Stability and Regulation:</strong> Political stability and clear regulations reduce risk and encourage investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Zoning Laws:</strong> Local regulations can designate specific areas for industrial development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>4. Combined Influences on Industrial Systems</h1>
    <h2>A. Scale of Production</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Small-Scale vs. Large-Scale Production:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Small-Scale:</strong> May be driven by limited local markets or niche products.</li>
          <li><strong>Large-Scale:</strong> Often requires access to extensive raw materials, labor, and efficient transport networks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Impact of Location:</strong> The mix of local factors (like resource availability and labour costs) influences whether a factory operates on a large or small scale.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>B. Methods of Organisation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Centralized vs. Decentralized Production:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> Single, large factories might benefit from economies of scale but may also incur higher risks if disrupted.</li>
          <li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Smaller, distributed factories can be more flexible and resilient.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Innovation and Specialisation:</strong> Access to high technology and skilled labour promotes innovation and the organisation of production processes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>C. Product Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Product Types:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Products are shaped by available technology, labour skills, and raw materials.</li>
          <li>High technology industries may produce advanced electronics, pharmaceuticals, or specialized machinery.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Production processes also determine the type and amount of waste, influencing environmental management practices.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Shared Facilities:</strong> Access to common services like waste management, utilities, and transport links.</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Management:</strong> Zoning helps manage industrial impacts on surrounding areas.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>B. Siting Factors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Considerations include pollution control, waste management, and sustainable practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Proximity to Infrastructure:</strong> Ease of access to transport links, energy supply, and labour markets.</li>
