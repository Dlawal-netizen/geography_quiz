        <h1>Coastal Processes</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Coastal processes play a significant role in shaping the world's coastlines, influencing the formation of various landforms and the dynamic interactions between land and sea. These processes can be divided into <strong>erosion</strong>, <strong>transportation</strong>, and <strong>deposition</strong>, all of which are driven by wave action, tidal movements, and currents.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Wave Action</h2>
        <p>Waves are the primary agents of coastal processes and are generated by wind blowing across the surface of the sea. The energy of a wave depends on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wind speed</li>
            <li>Duration of wind</li>
            <li>Fetch: The distance over which the wind blows across open water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two main types of waves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constructive Waves:</strong> Low-energy waves with a strong swash and weak backwash, building up beaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Destructive Waves:</strong> High-energy waves with a strong backwash and weak swash, removing material from the coast.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Coastal Erosion</h2>
        <p>Erosion is the wearing away of the coastline by wave action, currents, and tides. The key processes of coastal erosion are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hydraulic Action:</strong> The force of waves compresses air in cracks, weakening and breaking the rock.</li>
            <li><strong>Abrasion:</strong> Rocks carried by waves scrape and wear away the cliff face.</li>
            <li><strong>Attrition:</strong> Rocks and pebbles collide, breaking into smaller, smoother pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Weak acids in seawater dissolve soluble minerals like limestone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Coastal Transportation</h2>
        <p>Transportation involves the movement of material along the coastline, influenced by wave action. Processes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traction:</strong> Large boulders and rocks roll along the seabed.</li>
            <li><strong>Saltation:</strong> Small pebbles and stones bounce along the seabed.</li>
            <li><strong>Suspension:</strong> Fine particles, such as silt, are carried within the water column.</li>
            <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Dissolved minerals are transported invisibly in the water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Longshore Drift:</strong> Material moves in a zigzag motion along the coast due to angled wave approaches.</p>

        <h2>4. Coastal Deposition</h2>
        <p>Deposition occurs when waves lose energy and deposit material. Influencing factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decrease in wave energy</li>
            <li>Presence of obstacles, such as vegetation or groynes</li>
            <li>Supply of sediment from rivers or eroded cliffs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depositional landforms include beaches, spits, bars, and tombolos.</p>

        <h2>5. Coastal Landforms</h2>
        <p>Coastal landforms are categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Erosional Landforms:</strong> Cliffs, wave-cut platforms, caves, arches, stacks, and stumps.</li>
            <li><strong>Depositional Landforms:</strong> Beaches, spits, bars, and tombolos.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Coastal Management</h2>
        <p>Coastal management involves strategies to protect coastlines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Engineering:</strong> Sea walls, groynes, rock armour, and gabions.</li>
            <li><strong>Soft Engineering:</strong> Beach nourishment, managed retreat, and dune regeneration.</li>
        </ul>
